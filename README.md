# Project---We-Rate-Dogs-Dataset-Wrangle-and-Analyze-The-Data

This was the second project completed in the Udacity Data Analyst Certificate Course

## BACKGROUND
WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates user-submitted dog pictures with humorous ratings and comments.
The account has been active since November 2015, but the dataset in this wrangling effort only covers the period from 2015 to 2017.

## OBJECTIVE
Real-world data rarely comes clean and the dataset in this case is no exception.
The dataset needed to be wrangled comes from three separate sources and in three different formats.
Using Python and its libraries, the objective is to gather all these data from their various sources and formats, assess their quality & tidiness and then clean them.
The final aim of the wrangling effort is to have a relatively clean dataset which would be conducive for getting meaningful insights from WeRateDogs' twitter data from 2015 - 2017

Also two reports were generated during this project. 
- A report on the wrangling actions taken to clean the data
- A reeport on the analysis derivied from the cleaned data

Both reports were submitted in pdf formats
